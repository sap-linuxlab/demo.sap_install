# tasks file for powervc_createkeypair
#
# Ansible controller starts ssh-agent, when a machine credential is added to the template
# So the public key from that credential can be found
# The description of the ssh-key is replaced because it is dynamically created by every run
# Hence the playbook fails once the key exists
#
# This works also on the shell -- but a lot of keys might be generated
#
